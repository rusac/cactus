## Welcome to Cactus Club (est.2016)

The goal of Cactus Club is to cultivate cacti and succulents from seeds and cuttings. The only materials you are asked to bring are small, clean, plastic containers such as those from yogurt or sour cream. These will be used as pots for our seeds and cuttings. All other materials will be provided.

Current seed offerings are listed below. Members are encouraged to research the names of the cacti to determine which they would like to cultivate. One great source is [Cactus-Art.biz](http://www.cactus-art.biz/gallery/Photo_gallery_abc_cactus.htm) which has excellent information and lots of wonderful pictures.
