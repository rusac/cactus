# Welcome to Cactus Club (est.2016)

The goal of Cactus Club is to cultivate cacti and succulents from seeds and cuttings. The only materials required are small, clean, plastic containers such as those from yogurt or sour cream. These will be used as pots for the seeds and cuttings. All other materials will be provided.

Current seed offerings are listed below. Members are encouraged to research the names of the cacti to determine which they would like to cultivate. One great source is [Cactus-Art.biz](http://www.cactus-art.biz/gallery/Photo_gallery_abc_cactus.htm) which has excellent information and lots of wonderful pictures.

### CITES and Eco-stewardship

"[CITES](https://cites.org) (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international agreement between governments. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival" (https://cites.org). Seeds used in Cactus Club have been obtained from sustainable garden centres, not the wild.
